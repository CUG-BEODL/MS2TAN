MS$^2$TAN is named after **M**ulti-**S**cale **M**asked **S**patial-**T**emporal **A**ttention **N**etwork.

**Since the original code implementation is rather messy, we will open the source code after organizing it. Please stay tuned for future updates.**


## Quick view

The overall flowchart of the proposed method consists of two main components: a Multi-scale Restoration Network with MSTA-based Feature Extractors, and a ``Pixel-Structure-Perception'' Multi-Objective Joint Optimization method.
